This project takes a raw booking dataset, cleans it, and prepares it for analysis. The process involves handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies to create a clean and reliable dataset for data analysis and machine learning tasks. The primary goal is to transform the raw `Bookings.csv` file into a clean `cleaned_booking.csv` file.

## Key Features
* **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: Loads the raw booking data and performs an initial assessment of its structure and quality.
* **Handling Missing Values**: Implements strategies to handle missing data in various columns.
* **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Cleans and transforms data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
* **Data Visualization**: Includes basic data visualizations to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.

## Tech Stack
* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:
    * Pandas
    * NumPy
    * Seaborn
    * Matplotlib

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Required Python packages can be installed via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
    ```

## Installation & Local Development
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file with the packages listed in the Tech Stack section.)*

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook datacleaned.ipynb
    ```

## Configuration
There are no environment variables or special configurations required for this project.

## Usage/Examples
The primary usage is to run the cells in the `datacleaned.ipynb` notebook sequentially. This will load the `Bookings.csv` dataset, perform all the cleaning and transformation steps, and save the cleaned data to `cleaned_booking.csv`.

Here's a snippet demonstrating how to load the data:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the raw data
data = pd.read_csv("Bookings.csv")

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
## Running Tests
There are no automated tests for this project.
